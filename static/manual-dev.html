    <div id="main">

        <p>Please, read <a href="manual.html">user documentation</a> and <a href="manual-admin.html">administrator documentation</a> before this developer documentation in order to understand some basic concepts.</p>
        
        <h2 class="margintop">Building from source</h2>
        <p>The simplest way to build the software is to run <code>build-release.sh</code> (<code>build-release.cmd</code> for Windows) command, and then you can run <code>./edm</code> (<code>edm.exe</code> for windows) app in the current directory. These scripts produce a smaller executable with some flags.</p>
        <p>You can manually run <code>go build</code> in the <b>cmd/edm</b> directory, then move <b>cmd/edm/edm</b> (<b>cmd\edm\edm.exe</b> for windows) executable two directories up, and then run it from the root project directory.</p>
        <p>You should have the Go compiler and a C compiler (like one supplied with GCC or MinGW) on your system installed.</p>
        <p><b>Dockerfile</b> and <b>docker-compose.yml</b> files are available to run the software with Docker.</p>
        <p><b>addicon.cmd</b> is for adding the program icon into the exe file in Windows - this requires <a href="http://angusj.com/resourcehacker/">Resource Hacker</a> on your system.</p>
        <p><b>run-unix.sh</b> is a more convenient way to run the software while developing it.</p>
        <p>In order to know some constants and structs of the app read the package documentation available in the source files, for example with <code>go doc --all</code> command.</p>
        <p>All compilers, interpreters, executables which are necessary to build the software should be available in the path variable of your environment.</p>

        <h2 class="margintop">Python code generation</h2>
        <p>If you require to use more configuration options as environment variables you can edit <b>config-env.py</b> from the <b>internal/config</b> directory. The file has the predefined list of prefixes for environment variables. For instance, you can set it to <code>[""]</code> in order to make all config options available as environment variables.</p>
        <p>If you add some structs which require creating tables in a database, you can run <code>go generate</code> command from the <b>internal/core</b> directory to launch <b>sql-gen.py</b> python script to create sql scripts. This runs python3 and requires it to be installed on your system.</p>
        <p>If you modify server config code, you can run <code>go generate</code> command from the <b>internal/config</b> directory to launch <b>config-gen.py</b> and <b>config-env.py</b> python scripts to rewrite config loading and saving functions. This runs python3 and requires it to be installed on your system.</p>

        <h2 class="margintop">View pages as JSON</h2>
        <p>The program can display a response in JSON format. It is applicable for almost any page. This might be useful for connecting this server to other services.</p>
        <p>To load a page as JSON use the following key and value in GET or POST request: <code>api=json</code>.</p>
        
        <h2 class="margintop">Themes</h2>
        <p>Any theme is a single css file (except which name starts with <b>system-</b> prefix) and which is located in the <b>static/themes</b> directory.</p>
        <p>To add a new theme you just need to create that file with selectors like in other files and place it in the <b>static</b> directory. After restarting of the server, the new theme will appear on the settings page.</p>
        
        <h2 class="margintop">Localization</h2>
        <p>There are two JSON files which contain language-specific strings. Name of these files is two-letter language code and .json extension.
            Server-side files are located in the <b>i18nserver</b> directory, and they are relatively small as they are used only for login page and email notifications.
            Frontend localization files are located in the <b>static/i18n</b> directory, and they contain a lot more strings, almost all user interface language. Users can easily switch their interface language on the settings page.
        </p>
        <p>To add a new language you need to create those two JSON files with the same structure as existing ones. You need to edit <b>codesui.js</b> file to add a language name there and restart the server.</p>
