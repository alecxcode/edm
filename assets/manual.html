        <h2 class="margintop">Application Description</h2>
        <p>This software is an electronic document management and task tracking multiuser web-based environment.</p>
        <p>Usually is it easy to use and user experience is quite intuitive, so this manual is only to clarify some functions.</p>
        <p>Every separate group of elements which have a title in the navigation bar is called in this project the "base".</p>
        <h2 class="margintop">Basic setup and logging in</h2>
        <p>This software requires that you use modern web browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, Safari with enabled JavaScript. If you experience corrupted displaying of content, not functioning controls, etc., please verify that your browser is up to date.</p>
        <p>You need only a browser and a link to a website with installed EDM server to use the software. Your login name and password should be obtained from your system administrator. Use them exactly as they are. You can change them on your profile page.</p>
        <h2 class="margintop">Permissions in general</h2>
        <p>Users profiles in the system may have administrator role or may have no role. Only administrators can create, delete, edit other user profiles and companies. Users can edit their own profiles. </p>
        <p>Users with no role can create other objects: documents, tasks. Creator of an object becomes its owner.</p>
        <p>Only creators (owners) can edit and delete their objects. Administrator may on a server level disable the permission to delete objects even for owners.</p>
        <p>It is strongly advised not to delete anything, as someone my post links to your objects somewhere else.</p>
        <p>All users can view any objects.</p>
        <h2 class="margintop">User profiles, companies, settings</h2>
        <p>User profile represent a person who use the software. There is a list of registered users (Team base), from where it is available a list of companies.</p>
        <p>Each user profile has a set of configuration options available on the setting page. They are easy to understand. It is recommended to review them to make your experience more handy and convenient.</p>
        <p>Companies are created by administrator and they may include units (departments). A user may be an employee of a unit and, therefore, of a respective company.</p>
        <h2 class="margintop">Documents</h2>
        <p>Document is an object which represents a document from the real world. </p>
        <p>Documents base may be used to register and store company contracts with all their addenda, incoming and outgoing letters, any internal, corporate regulations, etc.</p>
        <h2 class="margintop">Tasks</h2>
        <p>Task is an object representing a separate job or a task process from the real world, where one or several people do something, discuss it, attach files, etc.</p>
        <p>A task has a creator (owner) who initiated it, an assignee who is the main person responsible for task to be done, and other participants, who may do part of the job, or approve, or discuss the process.</p>
        <p>Task commenting is only available to creators, assignees and participants of the task.</p>
        <p>Task creators or assignees can forward task to another assignee, add participants, change task status.</p>
